# The blueprint template project

This project will be about how easy it can be to convert general models of an idea to implementations that are usefull to actual users.

# Sandbox folder

In this folder the output files for the different programs will be directed.
This is for now a temporary use to make sure things are working.


# FPA

What are the primary moving parts of this project?

## Indicative FPA.
Formula: ILGV * 35 + KGV * 15

The Internal Data collections (ILGV) that come to mind are.
- Model
- File (Future idea)
- Feature
- Version

This means
35 * 4 = 140 fp of work to make all of that happen.

## Global FPA
Formula: ILGV * 7 + KGV * 5 + IF * 4 + OF * 4 + UF * 5

Models are mostly related to mental models of how we think in a bit of a higher level about most parts of programs.
Models describe everything that can be expressed through code.
This can be Functions that implement parts of a calculator.
This can be the parts of code that implement a webserver.
As long as the model get's the right title variables assigned in the program nobody ask's further.
(IF + UF + OF)

For features there needs to be a checklist table crossreferencing the models that are required to make it work.
(IF + UF + OF)

For a Version there needs to be the same checklist table crossreferencing the features that are required to make it work.
(IF + UF + OF)

For the first parts of the project the file will be something that is standardly given by the version that we are building.
()


This means
20 + 20 + 20 + 7 = 67 fp of work to make all of that happens
